# The remote server containing the repositories you want to watch
# GitTail will connect to this host using SSH and run "git log".
# You need to have key based SSH authentication set up for this to work.
#
# host = "example.com"


# Path to the Git repositories
# Construct the path so that `ls -d $git_path` enumerates the repos
# you want to watch.
#
# repo_path = "/home/git/*/*.git"


# How often GitTail opens a new SSH connection and gathers statistics
#
# poll_interval = 60
